7. Research and understand login strategy:

    1. How is the logged in user being kept track of?
    
        - Using the CURR_USER_KEY variable and the global namespace

    2. What is Flaskâ€™s g object?
    
        - Global namespace object that holds data you want during a single app context

    3. What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?
    
        - It adds the current user to the Flask global object

    4. What does @app.before_request mean?

        - It is a handler that makes g.user accessible to the routes and other functions

## Part 2: Add Likes

1. Added likes:
    
    - allow users to like a warble
    - allow users to unlike a warble
    - on profile page show how many warbles that user has liked, and link to page showing all liked warbles
